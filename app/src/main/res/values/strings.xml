    <string name="gatsby">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
        me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever
        since.
        “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just
        remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
        He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually
        communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
        meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
        many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not
        a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and
        attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,
        and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
        being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of
        wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought —
        frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate
        revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I
        am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as
        my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a
        sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally
        at birth.
        And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the
        admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the
        hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t
        care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last
        autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a
        sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous
        excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only
        Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt
        from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for
        which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken
        series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises
        of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines
        that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic
        readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
        which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby
        turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby,
        what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men.</string>
